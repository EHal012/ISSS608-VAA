It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\n\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\n\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n## 1.1.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:\n\n##1.1.6 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04-2-_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n##1.1.7 Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04-2-_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n“ns” → only non-significant “s” → only significant “all” → everything\n\n##1.1.8 Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04-2-_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n##1.1.9 Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : ggbarstats() methods In the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam1 <- exam %>% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04-2-_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
